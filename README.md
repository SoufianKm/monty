# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Welcome to the C Programming project repository focused on implementing Stacks and Queues! 🚀

## Overview

This project delves into the creation of Stacks (Last-In, First-Out - LIFO) and Queues (First-In, First-Out - FIFO) in the C programming language. Stacks and Queues are essential data structures with versatile applications in computer science.

## General
- What do LIFO and FIFO mean
- What is a stack, and when to use it
- What is a queue, and when to use it
- What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
- What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- What is the proper way to use global variables
